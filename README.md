# Double Commander themes
## What is Double Commander?
Since you're here, you probably know already...
> [Double Commander](https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/) is a free cross platform open source file manager with two panels side by side. It is inspired by Total Commander and features some new ideas.

## What are Double Commander themes?
Well, DC doesn't have themes per se. Instead you have limited panel customization options, which are stored in main config file.  
Therefore, you are able to set the look you like, backup config and reuse it whenever you want.  

## Installation
1. Choose theme from this repo.
2. Locate your DC config file (`doublecmd.xml`).
3. Replace the appropriate config fragments.
4. Enjoy!
